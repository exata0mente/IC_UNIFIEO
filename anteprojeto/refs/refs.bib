@article{Leek2016,
abstract = {This book is an opinionated guide to being a scientist using modern internet-enabled research, teaching, publishing, and communication tools. The primary audience for this book is students, postdocs, and faculty members in academic science roles. There are a now a large number of tools that are available to academic scientists that can speed and improve all aspects of a scientific career. As with many things, while the future is already here, it is not evenly distributed. I hope this book will smooth that out a little. In this book I will cover a range of tools that can be used to build a modern scientific career. Many of these tools overlap with the open-science, reproducible research, and scientific communication communities. My goal with this book was not to cater to any one of these specific communities, but to the practicing scientist who wants to take advantage of modern technologies but whose research program may not focus on any specific scientific revolution. The traditional academic scientist worked on research, submitted papers to peer reviewed journals, reviewed for those same journals, and was judged solely on their research productivity. Research productivity was usually defined as the number and quality of peer reviewed papers. Few other academic outputs carried much weight. That is slowly changing. Increasingly, scientific commu- nication, good software, reproducible research, open science, and other non-traditional outputs are being recognized. As this happens, some of the tools and approaches discussed in this book willmove from interesting and tangentially useful, to standard and required. But almost none have made that leap so far. The tools that enable this book to be written have all arisen over the last two decades, with many of the tools becoming available only in the last several years. The nice thing about this rapid technological revolution in academic science is that there are still relatively few codified guidelines for how to use them. I'm going to explain some ways I have used the tools, but keep in mind that in every area I will discuss both the technologies and their use is rapidly evolving. Themodern academic scientist develops code in the open, publishes data and code open source, posts preprints of their academicwork, still submits to traditional journals, and reviews for those journals, but may also write blog posts or use social media to critique published work in post-publication review fora. These activities can dramatically increase the profile of scientists, particularly junior scientists, if donewell. But their value for important career milestones such as promotion and tenure or getting grants, is still often muted or fuzzy.},
